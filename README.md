### Problem Statement
As a reminder, our goal is to look at transcripts of various comedians and note their similarities and differences. Specifically, I'd like to know if Ali Wong's comedy style is different than other comedians, since she's the comedian that got me interested in stand up comedy.

### Getting The Data
Luckily, there are wonderful people online that keep track of stand up routine transcripts. Scraps From The Loft makes them available for non-profit and educational purposes.

To decide which comedians to look into, I went on IMDB and looked specifically at comedy specials that were released in the past 5 years. To narrow it down further, I looked only at those with greater than a 7.5/10 rating and more than 2000 votes. If a comedian had multiple specials that fit those requirements, I would pick the most highly rated one. I ended up with a dozen comedy specials.
